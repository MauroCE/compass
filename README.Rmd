# compass

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of compass is to exemplify a toy R package for the personal portfolio of the Statistical Computing 1 course attended by first year PhD students in Computational Statistics and Data Science (COMPASS) at the University of Bristol.

## Installation

You can install the released version of compass from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("compass")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MauroCE/compass")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(compass)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
