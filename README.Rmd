<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of compass is to exemplify a toy R package for the personal portfolio of the Statistical Computing 1 course attended by first year PhD students in Computational Statistics and Data Science (COMPASS) at the University of Bristol.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MauroCE/compass")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to use the compass package.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
# Attach the package
library(compass)
# Find the sum of the squares of two numbers
z <- sumsquares(2, 4)
# and tilt the head of a dataframe
df <- data.frame(matrix(1:30, 10, 3))
tilted_head <- tilt_head(df, 3)
```
we can check the output 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
2^2 + 4^2
```
and 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
t(head(data.frame(matrix(1:30, 10, 3)), 3))
```
